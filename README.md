# ðŸ“š Interactive Reading Experience â€“ An Embodied Interaction Study

This project explores how environmental cues â€” specifically **music and lighting** â€” can influence emotional engagement during traditional book reading. Using passages from *Tuesdays with Morrie*, we investigated how sensory stimuli affect **enjoyment**, **immersion**, and **reader experience** through a controlled, interactive study setup.

## âœ¨ Project Highlights

- ðŸ”¦ Dynamic lighting conditions based on emotional tone
- ðŸŽµ Background music tailored to "Sad" or "Not Sad" narrative passages
- ðŸ“Š Quantitative and qualitative data analysis using Cohen's Kappa, Likert scales, and correlation matrices
- ðŸ“˜ Focused on embodied interaction and emotional resonance in reading

## ðŸ§  My Contributions

As a team member on this course project, I contributed to:

- Designing the user study environment and protocol
- Collecting and analyzing qualitative/quantitative user feedback
- Implementing environmental cue logic in Python
- Writing and co-authoring the final report and visualizing results

## ðŸ”¬ Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Script to simulate lighting/music logic
- **Google Forms & Excel** â€“ Data collection and analysis
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ For visualizing results (optional)
- **Cohenâ€™s Kappa** â€“ For validating inter-rater reliability

## ðŸ“Œ Future Scope

- Add support for haptic feedback or scent-based triggers
- Use sensors to personalize lighting/music based on real-time biometrics
- Expand to educational and therapeutic reading contexts
